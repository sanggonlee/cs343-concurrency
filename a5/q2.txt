This is a deadlock.
Assuming that by "block" we mean an Angel is in stone state waiting for 
an entity to blink, the Angels are waiting for each other to blink but
they all blocked so none of them can actually blink. Since the Angels don't
change states while they are blocking, (in stone state) this is not a livelock.
