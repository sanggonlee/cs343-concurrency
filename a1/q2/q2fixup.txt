i.
Original code without optimization: 10.232s
Transformed code without optimization: 6.873s

Original code with optimization: 6.891s
Transformed code with optimization: 3.275s

ii.
Both with and without optimization, the transformed code ran faster.

iii.
Because resumptions should be rare in real world. Fixup routine was implemented simply by function pointer, so it should be fast.
